horse_ebookmarklet
==================

A bookmarklet to convert the internet to [@Horse_ebooks](http://www.twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/).

Pulls the last 200 tweets from [@Horse_ebooks](http://www.twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/) and replaces the text on a selected web page.

Install the bookmarklet [here](http://www.heyben.com/horse_ebookmarklet/), or just run this JS from your console.

### No jQuery

Recently I went back and removed the requirement for jQuery to increase performance and cut down filesize. The bookmarklet is now less than 2K and much faster, though it may not have _quite_ the browser compatibility it once had. It should still work on all modern browsers.
